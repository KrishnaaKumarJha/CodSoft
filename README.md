# CodSoft
Contains all the work I have done under CodSoft as an Data Science Intern.
Under This Internship I made following three projects:

1. Credit Card Fraud Detection:
   In this Project my motive was to create a program that can detect credit card frauds. I tested it using the datasets provided by codsoft.

2. Sales Predictions using Simple Linear Regression:
   Under this project i was instructed to predict the future sales of an organization using the given set of data.

3. Titanic Survival Predictions:
   In this I had to predict the survival chances of the people present on the Titanic using the tested datasets provied by CodSoft.

All the Datasets used and the program files have been provided in the repository.
